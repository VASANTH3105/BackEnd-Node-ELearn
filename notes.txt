|-> Client (type domain name) here browser makes a request to DNS (domain name id not the real address)
|-> DNS (domain name to IP address) matches to same IP address
|-> Server (has IP address) (a TCP/IP socket connection will be established between client and server)

Sending a http request (a protocol help to communicate between client and server)

Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 1234

As a backend developer we are not aware about the request type. But want ot ensure
